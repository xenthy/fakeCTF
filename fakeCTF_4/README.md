# Misc: IC what you did there

This challenge requires you to validate Singapore Identity Card numbers. That's about it.

Things to note:
- Do not edit/move the file/contents of `encrypted.txt` and `list.txt`
- For the `fakeCTF_4.py` file, add your code only in the `main()` function, edit the other functions at your own risk
- This was built on Python 3.8. However, it should work on > Python 3.6
- You will need to install some dependencies

```bash
> cd C:\Path\To\requirements.txt
# make sure pip is set in your env
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Disclaimer: The IC numbers in `list.txt` is **NOT** a collection of existing IC numbers, they were randomly generated.
